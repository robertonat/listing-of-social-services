        The first thing to consider when looking at this data is the percentage makeup. Data detailing where wifi hotspots are make up over half the entries.

        However even taking away the data that was provided by wifi hotspots shows some discrepency between the remaining results
        <br>
        Child care and women oriented resources make up the majority of the remaining data sets.

        <br>
        This is simply due to the difference in amount of data avalible for each tag. The wifi had about 3000+ data entries while some others had less than 100.
        It is important to also note the difference in infrastructure between the tags. Wifi hotspots are easier to set up and scatter around than entire
        buildings funded by organizations full of volunteers and administrative individuals. Another interesting analysis to look at would be the make up of
        what is in each borough. Unlike the tags it is possible that the data entries would have split their locations evenly amoung the five boroughs.

        It can be seen the Queens has the highest number of instances in the data, with almost double the amount held by the next highest in Brooklyn. As previously
        discussed this distribution could be influenced greatly by the wifi data. Staten Island has by far the lowest.The Bronx is barely at above 500. Looking at the same
        type of distribution, but this time with out wifi hotspots leads to a slightly different result.

        <br>
        We can see that the distribution is still similiar to its previous analysis. But this time the difference in boroughs is much smaller. The smaller boroughs like
        The Bronx and Staten Island are still lower than the rest, but the amount theyve decreased by is much smaller. Both seem to have lost around 100 rows of data each.
        Queens however was previously well in the mid 2000s, has suddenly dropped to just about 800. More than half of Queens instances were about wifi hot spots. Brooklyn
        is now only 100 instances away from Queens compared to being less than half of Queens previously.
